# Car Insurance Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves performing an exploratory data analysis(EDA) on an automobile dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights within the data. The primary goal is to understand the stucture and quality of the dataset, identify key variables, and evaluate their distribution and relationships.

## Data Source(s)

Automobile Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "automobile_dataset.csv" file containing detailed information about various cars including their technical specifications, insurance risk ratings and normalised loss values.

## Tool(s)

Python

## Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
- Data loading and inspection
- Detect columns or rows with missing values
- Remove duplicates and inconsistencies
- Fix outliers and incorrect entries
- Data cleaning and formatting - (data types)

## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involves exploring the data to answer key questions such as:
1. What are the different car makes(brands) represented in the dataset
2. What type of fuel (gas, diesel) and body styles(sedan, hatchbacks,etc) are most common
3. What is the average price of a car in the dataset
4. Which car features are associated with higher risks (e.g., higher price, engine size, horsepower)?
5. Which cars are more likely to be owned by customers who value fuel efficiency (for eco-driving policies)?
6. Does vehicle weight (curb-weight) influence the likelihood or severity of damage in accidents?
7. How can price segmentation be used to create premium categories (e.g., economy, mid-range, luxury)?
8. What is the cost difference between gas and diesel cars, and how should this affect policy pricing?
9. Which vehicle attributes suggest a higher likelihood of expensive repairs or replacement?
10. How can the company segment its vehicle-owning clients for better-targeted insurance offerings (e.g., young drivers, low-income drivers)?
